## Software Developer

I’ve built several apps as an amateur using no-code tools Bubble, which I believe offers one of the best platforms for rapidly creating software products. Now I’m dedicating myself to studying traditional programming so I can help small businesses bring their ideas to life professionally, delivering simple, cost-effective apps in minimal time.

I’ve created multiple Bubble applications and have foundational skills in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python, and SQL. Currently I’m deepening my knowledge through a coding school, working on projects in C. I’m eager to continue learning and contribute new projects to my portfolio.
